First us "mgrast-parser-seeds.py' need to designate an output file. The output 
will be a file with all sites and subsystem levels separated by '|'

Then can use either of the "subsystem" scripts.  "subsystem-parser.py" will 
produce a file with all of the subsystem present and can specify which 
subsystem level you want shown by changing the "LEVEL" number in the script.

"subsystem-selector.py" is the same as the "subsystem-prser.py" script except
 it lets you pick which subsystem you want specific information on.  Pick
 which subsystem you want by removing the '#' from infront of one of the 
general subsystem categories.

"mgrast-parser-seeds.py" and "subsystem-parser.py" were both written by Adina 
Howe

"subsystem-selector.py" was modified from "subsystem-parser.py" by Aaron 
Garoutte.
